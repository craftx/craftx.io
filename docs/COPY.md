## Features

### Open Source
The source code for this website is up on github and you're welcome to take a peak and see what you can reuse. You can also contribute and join us for our learning sessions, if you're into that sort thing;)

### Weekly Hangouts
We are a small group of Craft CMS developers and CraftX contributors and we enjoy getting together once a week to talk about code, design, freelancing, and work/life balance. You're welcome to join us or eavesdrop, if that's how you roll.

### Mise en place
We want to give Craft CMS developers, plugins, projects, and articles, a place to shine. Bring every everything together into a beautiful and digestible pile of Craft goodness.
